# Disclaimer/Talk Rules

* These are based on my personal experience, YMMV
* I thought this was something cool to talk about, I have not made anything 'production' ready
* If you know more than me or can correct me, speak up.
* If you have questions please ask!
* If you want to argue about something, buy me a beer later.

# Why am I giving this talk?

^ This topic really interested me and I struggled a little bit getting started. I hope to inspire you and help you avoid some frustration I had.

## IoT LOL WUT?

> The Internet of things (IoT) is the inter-networking of physical devices, vehicles (also referred to as "connected devices" and "smart devices"), buildings, and other itemsâ€”embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity that enable these objects to collect and exchange data. - Wikipedia

# What is a Photon

> A tiny, reprogrammable Wi-Fi development kit for prototyping and scaling your Internet of Things product

# How do you get started?
* Buy some hardware
* Signup at [https://www.particle.io/](https://www.particle.io/)
* Download the smartphone app

---
# Tinker Mode

---
# Let's try it out

---
## Tinker Demo
### Setting up the Photon

* This is also how you connect to a new WI-FI, just make sure you don't skip ahead and connect to the devices network before hitting ready on this screen.

^ The smart phone app guides you very well

---
## Tinker Demo
### Setting up the Photon

* The device emits it's own wireless network for setup.

## Tinker Demo
### Setting up the Photon

* They give you funky names, you can however rename it if you want

![fit right](./images/IMG_0362.PNG)

---
## Tinker Demo
### Playing with your device

* Tinker mode gives you a gives you a virtual interface to your board.
* We have two lites already attached to our bread board, let's light up the Red one

---
## Tinker Demo
### Playing with your device

* We blinked a light over the internet!

# That's cool but...
## I can't just watch the build status and click a button

---
# To the cloud

# Sample App

* They have a few, we'll try the `BLINK AN LED` app

![fit right](./images/2017-04-21 at 3.27 PM.png)

---
# Sample App

* To send it to our Photon we just need to `flash` the device
* Well it is sending to our device let's look at the code

![fit right](./images/2017-04-21 at 3.28 PM.png)

---
# blink-an-led.ino

```javascript
int led1 = D0;
int led2 = D7;

void setup() {
  pinMode(led1, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(led2, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(led1, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(led2, HIGH);

  delay(1000);

  digitalWrite(led1, LOW);
  digitalWrite(led2, LOW);

  delay(1000);
}

```

# Profit

---
# Now let's build something we can control

![](./images/man-person-hand-party.jpg)

---
# Creating a new app

* From the cloud IDE choose 'CREATE NEW APP'
* Call it something like `travis-ci-blink`
* Then add the code from [travis-ci-blink.ino](./code_samples/travis-ci-blink.ino)
* Then flash it to your Photon

---
# Let's look at the code

---

```javascript
SYSTEM_MODE(AUTOMATIC);

int red = D0;
int green = D1;

void setup()
{

   pinMode(red, OUTPUT);
   pinMode(green, OUTPUT);
   Particle.function("led",ledToggle);

   digitalWrite(red, LOW);
   digitalWrite(green, LOW);

}


int ledToggle(String command) {
  if (command=="red") {
      digitalWrite(red,HIGH);
      digitalWrite(green,LOW);
      return 1;
  }
  else if (command=="green") {
      digitalWrite(red,LOW);
      digitalWrite(green,HIGH);
      return 0;
  }
  else {
      return -1;
  }
}
```

---
# Now to interact with it.

* Using the [Particle API](https://docs.particle.io/reference/api/)
* You'll need your Device ID and Access Token

![right](./images/device_id_and_access_token.png)

---
# curl request to API

```bash
#!/bin/bash

$ACCESS_TOKEN="REDACTED"
$DEVICE_ID="REDACTED"

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
-H "Cache-Control: no-cache"  \
-d "access_token=${ACCESS_TOKEN}&arg=green" "https://api.particle.io/v1/devices/${DEVICE_ID}/led"
```

---
# On to Travis

* Create a new build process on https://travis-ci.org
* Then update the `.travis.yml` to contain blocks to call `curl` requests for success and failures.

---
# Sample `.travis.yml` for a Rails project

```yaml
language: ruby
cache: bundler
rvm:
  - 2.3.0
script:
  - bundle install --without production
  - bundle exec rails db:migrate
  - bundle exec rails test
after_success:
  - ./ci/success
after_failure:
  - ./ci/failure
```

# ci scripts

Failure

```bash
#!/bin/bash

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" \
-d "access_token=${ACCESS_TOKEN}&arg=red" \
"https://api.particle.io/v1/devices/${DEVICE_ID}/led"
```

Success

```bash

# Let's see this in action!

---
# Issues I ran into
* My lack of experience physically working with electronics
* Not reading directions!
* Setup and teardown caused me not to get excited when it was "Hack Time"
